            Contract
        </h2>
        <p>
            I, SHA'RON J. BYERS agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my SEMESTER
            2025, Spring, ITSC1110 with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be
            available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate
            for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
        </p>   
            
        <p>
            I also understand that it is my
            work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,
            failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. 
        </p>
            
        <p>
            I also understand that given
            the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online
            or even view my classmates’ code directly. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I will only use these resources to
            learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit
            (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
        </p>

        <p>
