        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal background:</strong> Born in Texas but have spent most of my life here in North Carolina. I live in Monroe, NC which is about 40 minutes away from Charlotte. I have one brother. </li>
            <li><strong>Professional background:</strong> I was an assistant manager at a car wash for about three years. This past summer I had the opportunity to intern at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina as an IT Network Engineer Intern. </li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> Before coming here to UNC Charlotte, I went to a high school where I had the opportunity to study cybersecurity there for 4 years. I also took some classes at a local community college during my junior and senior years to coincide with the work I was doing there. Now, Iâ€™m a senior here at Charlotte in my final semester studying computer science with a concentration in cyber security. </li>
            <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I have lots of experience dating back to my high school years. There I was able to learn all the foundational stuff as it pertains to IT/CS. That made it a little easier to learn the new things that were taught in our CS program. </li>
            <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> MacBook Pro with Intel chip. I also have a Windows 11 platform. </li>
            <li><strong>Courses I'm in & Why:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>AMST 3100 - Intro to American Studies</strong> - I needed one more outside elective</li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 1110 - Intro to CS Principles</strong> - Needed to take an extra class for credit. But could also serve as a refresher for things I forgot about.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 3155 - Software Engineering</strong> - Required for degree</li>
                    <li><strong>ITIS 4246 - Competitive Cyber Defense</strong> - Capstone for CS degree</li>
                </ul>
